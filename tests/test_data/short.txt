Well, try this one and I’ll say it just once….Tell you what, we could’ve had a good life together! Fuckin’ real good life! Had us a place of our own. But you didn’t want it, Ennis! So what we got now is Brokeback Mountain! Everything’s built on that! That’s all we got, boy, fuckin’ all. So I hope you know that, even if you don’t never know the rest! You count the damn few times that we have been together in nearly twenty years and you measure the short fuckin’ leash you keep me on – and then you ask me about Mexico and you tell me you’ll kill me for needing somethin’ that I don’t hardly never get. You have no idea how bad it gets! And I’m not you – I can’t make it on a coupla high-altitude fucks once or twice a year! You are too much for me, Ennis, you sonofawhoreson bitch! I wish I knew how to quit you.
